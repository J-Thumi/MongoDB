MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database known for its flexibility, scalability, and developer-friendly features. It belongs to the document-oriented database category, where data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents instead of traditional rows and columns found in relational databases. Here’s an overview of MongoDB:

Key Features of MongoDB:
Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, schema-less documents, making it easy to store and query complex hierarchical data structures.

Schema Flexibility: Unlike relational databases, MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, allowing for dynamic and evolving data models.

Scalability: MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability, allowing for distributed database clusters to handle large volumes of data and high throughput.

Query Language: MongoDB uses a query language similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) called MongoDB Query Language (MQL), which supports rich query expressions and aggregation pipelines.

Indexing: MongoDB supports various types of indexes to improve query performance, including single-field, compound, text, geospatial, and hashed indexes.

High Availability: MongoDB supports automatic failover and replica sets, ensuring data availability and reliability.

Aggregation Framework: MongoDB provides an expressive and powerful aggregation framework for data analysis and transformation tasks.

Ad Hoc Queries: Developers can perform ad hoc queries on MongoDB without requiring predefined schemas or complex joins, facilitating rapid application development.

Use Cases for MongoDB:
Content Management: Storing and managing content such as blogs, articles, and multimedia.

Real-Time Analytics: Analyzing real-time data streams and performing complex aggregations.

Catalog and Product Data: Storing product catalogs and handling frequent updates and schema changes.

Mobile and Social Infrastructure: Backend storage for mobile apps, handling user profiles, messages, and social interactions.

IoT (Internet of Things): Storing and analyzing sensor data from IoT devices due to its flexible schema and scalability.

Why Choose MongoDB?
Flexibility: MongoDB’s flexible document model allows developers to work with evolving data models and adapt quickly to changing application requirements.

Scalability: MongoDB scales horizontally across clusters of commodity servers, supporting large-scale deployments and high availability.

Developer Productivity: Developers often prefer MongoDB for its ease of use, fast development cycles, and ability to handle unstructured or semi-structured data.

Community and Ecosystem: MongoDB has a large and active community, extensive documentation, and support resources, making it easier for developers to get started and resolve issues.

MongoDB is widely used across various industries and applications, from startups to large enterprises, for its ability to handle diverse data types, scale with ease, and support modern application development practices.

we can host mongodb by installing mongodb locally or use a hosted service like mongo atlas
make sure when installing you have also installed mongodb compass which is the UI like mysql in SQL
install mongodb shell also

mongodb stores data in collections and documents
it stores data in bson form
What is BSON? BSON stands for “Binary JSON,” and that's exactly what it was invented to be. BSON's binary structure encodes type and length information, which allows it to be traversed much more quickly compared to JSON.
This means that BSON is compact for transmitting over a network, while JSON is human-readable and easier to work with in various contexts.

Documents
A document in MongoDB is a basic unit of data. It is similar to a row in a relational database but is more flexible due to its schema-less nature. Documents are stored in BSON format, which allows them to store various data types, including nested arrays and objects.
Key Characteristics of Documents:
Key-Value Pairs: Each document is composed of key-value pairs, where keys are strings and values can be various data types (string, number, array, object, etc.).
Schema-Less: Documents in a collection do not need to have the same set of fields or structure.
Nested Documents: Documents can contain sub-documents, allowing for complex data structures.

Collections
A collection in MongoDB is a grouping of documents. It is analogous to a table in a relational database but without a fixed schema, allowing for a more flexible and dynamic data model.
Key Characteristics of Collections:
Group of Documents: Collections contain multiple documents, each potentially with different structures.
No Schema Enforcement: Documents within a collection can have different sets of fields and data types.
Dynamic Structure: Collections can be created implicitly by inserting a document.



the object can contain array string or even another object nested

open mongo compass if the database is hosted out of the localhost eg in atlas input the connection string then but its locally press connect and ensure the mongo server is running 
to start running the server just search services in the start then scroll to mongodb and make it start running

create a database and a collection in it add data in json format if you insert the id is automatically added
the database is bookstore and the collection books 
if adding more than one document i.e in the case this case books
ensure they are in an array
we can say a collection is an array of objects i.e documents

we can edit,delete documents using the icons on the top right corner on hover on the document
we can also filter what we want to see eg if we want to see books with a rating of 9 in the query type

        {rating:9}
the books with a rating of 9 will show

USING shell
we can use the shell in compass or the command prompt ie cmd  but both are the same in syntax
if cmd to enter in the mongo shell type mongosh then the shell will appear
  

  the key does not contain quotes when using shell
  it only contains when filtering using the properties in the nested docs

  to show the databases currently existing: show dbs
  to use a database : use dbname 
  the database can be existing prior or not
  to show current db we are in : db
  to show all collections in a database: show collections
  to get help with any command: help
  to exit the mongo shell: exit
  to add one new documents: db.collectionName.insertOne( object of the document you want to add)
  the key does not contain quotes
  you can also add documents to collections that do not exist the shell creates the collection and adds the document 
  to add several documents : db.collectionName.insertMany(array of the documents you want to add)
  to output the first 20 documents in the collection: db.collectionName.find()
  to show the next 20 : it
  to filter documents with same xtic: db.collectionName.find(the xtic you want in in object syntax whether one or many xtics)
  i.e db.books.find({author:"Magret"})
  the find method can have another argument of the properties I want to show
  to show specific properties: db.collectionName.find(the xtic you want in in object syntax whether one or many xtics , object of the properties I want to show use the keys you want to see and assign values of 1 to them)
  e.g i.e db.books.find({author:"Magret"},{author:1, title:1})
  we always get the id back
  we can get all docs but only show specific properties of them
  i.e db.books.find({},{author:1, title:1})
  this means we have nothing to filter with
  returns the author and title of first 20 remember id ALWAYS shows
  in symple terms the find method: db.collectionName.find({filter by what parameter},{fields to show})
  to get a single document: db.collectionName.findOne({},{})
  the syntax is the same to find()

we can chain methods to sort, limit number of docs to get or get the number of documents returned
    to get number of documents: db.collectionName.find().count()
    to limit number of docs; db.collectionName.find().limit(number of docs to return)
    to sort: db.collectionName.find().sort(sort by what in object form)
    eg db.collectionName.find().sort({title:1})
    the 1 means in ascending order if descending use -1
    you can sort and limit in a single statement


key is the field name value is the field value in mongo terminology
i can say an object is a container of info of a specific item
eg the reviews document stores reviews of a specific book this reviews have different pple who post them the content is not the same and much more info is not the same so the review doc of a specific book becomes an array of objects the object contains the info of the review


we can nest documents to avoid having othe collections 
eg in the books document we can have the reviews belonging to the book nested in it 



complex queries and operators
operators are denoted by a dollar sign
maybe we want books with a rating greater than 7

        filter rating greater than 7: db.collectionName.find({rating: {$gt: 7} })

                            Comparison operators
            The following operators can be used in queries to compare values:
                        $eq: Values are equal
                        $ne: Values are not equal
                        $gt: Value is greater than another value
                        $gte: Value is greater than or equal to another value
                        $lt: Value is less than another value
                        $lte: Value is less than or equal to another value
                        $in: Value is matched within an array
                        $in: Value is matched not within an array


                                            Logical operators
                    The following operators can logically compare multiple queries.
                        $and: Returns documents where both queries match
                        $or: Returns documents where either query matches
                        $nor: Returns documents where both queries fail to match
                        $not: Returns documents where the query does not match

 or and nor require multiple key value pairs meaning we pass arrays to them
        eg db.Books.find({$or: [{rating: 8 },{rating: 9}]})  


                                        Evaluation
                The following operators assist in evaluating documents.
                    $regex: Allows the use of regular expressions when evaluating field values
                    $text: Performs a text search
                    $where: Uses a JavaScript expression to match documents

    the combo: db.Books.find({$or: [{rating: {$gt:7}}, {author:"magret"}]})

    $in and &nin
        we can use combinations of $or,$gte,$lte to access documents in a certain range 
        to simplify we can use $in

        db.Books.find({rating: {$in: [7,8,9]}})
        db.Books.find({rating: {$nin: [7,8,9]}})


    Books can be of 1,2 or even more genres  hence the genre key has an array of values
        1. to get where fantasy is : db.Books.find({genre: "fantasy"})
        2. to get where only fantasy is : db.Books.find({genre: ["fantasy"]})
        3. to get where only fantasy and magic are : db.Books.find({genre: ["fantasy", "magic"]})
        4. to get where fantasy and magic are : db.Books.find({genre: {$all: ["fantasy", "magic"]}})
        1 and 4 mean there can be other genres in the docs returned

    we can filter by the name of the person who sent a review
    the name is in the review doc which is in the Book doc
    db.Book.find("review.name": "Jos")


    deleting documents
    db.Books.deleteOne({_id: ObjectId('66865a73d52e03a663f3e702')})
    db.Books.deleteMany({author:"Magret"})


    we can import or export data to and from compass


                    updating documents
                we can use updateOne or updateMany
    to update one document: db.collectionName.updateOne({object containing what},{$set:{what you want to change}})
    db.Books.updateOne({_id: ObjectId('66865a73d52e03a663f3e702')},{$set: {author:"Jos"}})
    db.Books.updateOne({_id: ObjectId('66865a73d52e03a663f3e702')},{$set: {author:"Jos", pages:900}})

to update many documents: db.collectionName.updateOne({object containing what},{$set:{what you want to change}})
db.Books.updateMany({author: "Magret"} , {$set: {author:"Margrett"}})


            if you want to increament a value
            db.Books.updateOne({author:"Jos"},{$inc: {pages: 2}})
            db.Books.updateOne({author:"Jos"},{$inc: {pages: -2}})


            we can also add and revove values in an arrary using $push and $pull
            db.Books.updateOne({author:"Jos"},{$pull: {genre: "fantasy"}})

            to add several items to the array use the $each operator
            db.Books.updateOne({author:"Jos"},{$pull: {genre: {$each : [ "fantasy","magic"]}}})



            MongoDB drivers are libraries that enable applications to interact with a MongoDB database. They provide the necessary tools and functions to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and other database interactions using various programming languages.

                Key Features of MongoDB Drivers:
                Connectivity: Establish connections to MongoDB instances.
                CRUD Operations: Perform basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
                Query Language: Support MongoDB's query language for complex queries.
                Aggregation: Enable data aggregation using MongoDB's powerful aggregation framework.
                Indexing: Support creating and using indexes to optimize query performance.
                Transactions: Support multi-document ACID transactions in replica sets.
                Change Streams: Enable applications to listen for real-time data changes


MongoDB Node.js Driver
npm install mongodb



Basic Usage
Here's how you use the find() method in the MongoDB driver:

Install MongoDB Node.js Driver:
If you haven't already, install the MongoDB driver using npm:


npm install mongodb
Connect to MongoDB and Query Documents:


main().catch(console.error);
Querying with Filters
You can pass a query object to the find() method to filter documents based on specific criteria.

javascript
Copy code
// Find documents where the 'name' field is 'Alice'
const cursor = collection.find({ name: 'Alice' });
Projecting Fields
You can specify which fields to include or exclude in the returned documents using the projection option.

javascript
Copy code
// Find documents and only include the 'name' and 'age' fields
const cursor = collection.find({}, { projection: { name: 1, age: 1 } });
Limiting and Skipping Results
You can limit the number of documents returned and skip a certain number of documents using limit() and skip() methods.

javascript
Copy code
// Limit the number of documents to 5 and skip the first 10 documents
const cursor = collection.find().limit(5).skip(10);
Sorting Results
You can sort the results using the sort() method.

javascript
Copy code
// Sort documents by 'age' field in ascending order
const cursor = collection.find().sort({ age: 1 });
Example: Combining Filters, Projections, and Other Options
javascript
Copy code
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';
const dbName = 'myDatabase';

const client = new MongoClient(url, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

async function main() {
  try {
    await client.connect();
    console.log('Connected successfully to MongoDB');

    const db = client.db(dbName);
    const collection = db.collection('myCollection');

    // Query: Find documents where 'age' is greater than 25, project 'name' and 'age', limit to 5, skip the first 2, and sort by 'age'
    const cursor = collection.find(
      { age: { $gt: 25 } }, // Filter
      { projection: { name: 1, age: 1 } } // Projection
    ).limit(5).skip(2).sort({ age: 1 });

    await cursor.forEach((doc) => console.log(doc));
  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
}

main().catch(console.error);
Summary
find(query, projection): Used to query documents with optional projection to specify fields.
Cursor Methods:
cursor.forEach(callback): Iterates over each document.
cursor.limit(n): Limits the number of documents.
cursor.skip(n): Skips the first n documents.
cursor.sort(sortObj): Sorts the documents.
The find() method is a powerful and flexible way to query documents in MongoDB, providing a wide range of options to filter
, project, limit, skip, and sort the results.


when we are looking for items the database server goes thru all the collection to find the item in search
we can use indexes to simplify this operation in the shell

to know the info about a specific query: db.books.find({rating: 8}).explain('executionStats')
if you go to docsExamined it shows the number of books 
This can be time consuming and energy consuming too
To avoid this use indexes

To create an index: db.Books.createIndex({pages:209})
To get indexes: db.Books.getIndexes()

now if you: db.books.find({pages:209}).explain('executionStats')
if you go to docsExamined it shows the number of books in the index created above hence this operation is faster

To delete the index: db.Books.dropIndex({pages:209})




mongo atlas 
create a data base
copy the connection string
provide who can acess the database
